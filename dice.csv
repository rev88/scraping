Ideally want someone to come on board that already has it, if not they will work to get cert once they join the team.
Various industries are ok, don't have to come from the financial industry - NO FED BACKGROUNDS.
Day to Day:
Will be the lead's right hand. Want help with building automation frameworks. Will try different POCs and see if different tools will work. Very passionate to try various things. Good communication and presentation skills.
Mainly coding 80%- 90% of the day coding
Kanban- don’t have scripts, the developers pick up a task, once it's done they pick up the next task. Don’t operate based on sprint. Based on their availability they pick up more tasks.
UI automation. Have an angular application, need coverage for the UI part. Need this person to help ramp up automation and build frameworks to automate application- like how to test a specific component
